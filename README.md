### Hi, I’m @CezaryPukownik

Hello! I'm a dedicated data engineer with over 8 years of experience in the field, passionate about developing top-tier data pipelines that perfectly align with a company's unique requirements. I thrive on finding creative solutions to optimize processes and improve efficiency, and I genuinely enjoy the challenge of transforming complex data into clear, impactful business insights. When I'm not immersed in data, my interests span from the exciting world of music production to exploring new destinations through travel.
