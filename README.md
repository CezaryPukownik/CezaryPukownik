### Hi, I’m @CezaryPukownik

I am a data analyst with over 5 years of experience. I develop high quality data self-service tools that deliver insights to end users. I am always looking for things that can be improved and optimized. I can also process and analyze large amounts of data to provide business insights.

Besides programming, I am also interested in music production and travel.
