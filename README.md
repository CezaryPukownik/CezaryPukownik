### Hi, I’m @CezaryPukownik

I am a data engineer with over 8 years of experience in data processing. I develop high quality data pipelines that will satisfy companies needs. I am always looking for things that can be improved and optimized. I can also process and analyze large amounts of data to provide business insights.

Besides programming, I am also interested in music production and travel.
